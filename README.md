## StatRegressionJHUCaffo  
This repo is for summaries of a few e-book by Brian Caffo of JHU.  The books are on the topics of inferential statistics and regression, primarily using R.  Additionally, the rep covers the Practical Machine Learning Module (specifically the caret library) from the JHU Coursera series.  And, the repo contains some explorations of Machine Learning, the Ng Coursera Stanford course:
